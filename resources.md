This page links to some useful resources. We will likely be updating
this page.

## Pintos

The [JHU Pintos manual](assign/pintos/pintos.html) has a complete overview
of Pintos and the project sequence.

## Tools

The [Setup](assign/setup.html) page has the information you need to set
up your development environment.

If you will be doing development on your own machine, we highly recommend using the
[prebuilt i386-elf toolchain](https://github.com/jhu-cs318/cross-compiler-toolchain)
for building Pintos. See the [Setup](assign/setup.html) document for information
about building the Bochs emulator from source.
