## Pintos

The [JHU Pintos manual](assign/pintos/pintos.html) has a complete overview
of Pintos and the project sequence.

## Tools

The [Setup](assign/setup.html) page has the information you need to set
up your development environment.

If you will be doing development on your own machine, we highly recommend using the
[prebuilt i386-elf toolchain](https://github.com/jhu-cs318/cross-compiler-toolchain)
for building Pintos. See the [Setup](assign/setup.html) document for information
about building the Bochs emulator from source.

## Review material

The following homework assignments were prepared by
[Prof.\ Huang](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~ryanph/)
for the [Fall 2022 offering of OS](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~huang/cs318/fall22/).

They are not required or graded.
We recommend that you complete them on your own to help you
prepare for the exams. We will post solutions on Canvas,
and we encourage you to ask questions about these homework
problems when we do exam review sessions in class.
