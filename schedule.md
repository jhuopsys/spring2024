This page lists topics, readings, and has links to lecture slides.
It also lists assignment due dates.  Items <span class="tentative">in
gray italic</span> are tentative.

This schedule could change!  Changes
to the schedule will be announced in class and/or on
[Courselore](https://courselore.org/).

Readings are from [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/).
This is an open-source textbook, and you can use the links below to access the chapters
directly.

**Important**: do the reading *before*
you come to class.

The links to slides are provided for reference.  In general, there is no
guarantee that they will be posted before class, or that their content
will not change.

Acknowledgment: The course schedule and structure is based on
[Ryan Huang](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~ryanph/)'s [version of the course](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~huang/cs318/fall22/).
