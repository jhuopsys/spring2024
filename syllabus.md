## Course Information

* This course covers fundamental topics related to operating systems
  theory and practice. Topics include processor management, storage
  management, concurrency control, multi-programming and processing,
  device drivers, operating system components (e.g., file system, kernel),
  modeling and performance measurement, protection and security, and
  recent innovations in operating system structure. Course work includes
  the implementation of operating systems techniques and routines, and
  critical parts of a small but functional operating system.

## Course Expectations &amp; Grading

Class meetings will consist of lecture and discussion, with occasional
in-class activities.

Your course grade will be determined as follows:

* Exams: 40%

You have a total of 120 late hours to use as needed for homework
assignments throughout the course.
If you are planning on using more than 48 late hours on an assignment, please send a
private message to the instructors on Courselore to let us know. Note that
there could be restrictions on late hour use on the last assignment
of the semester. Assignment submissions which exceed the maximum number of
late hours will (generally) not be considered for credit.  Having said that,
we understand that exceptional circumstances can arise.  If you are in a
situation where you think you may need additional late hours, please notify
your instructor.

## Ethics

The strength of the university depends on academic and personal
integrity. In this course, you must be honest and truthful, abiding by the
[Computer Science Academic Integrity Code](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/academic-programs/academic-integrity-code/):

> Cheating is wrong. Cheating hurts our community by undermining academic
> integrity, creating mistrust, and fostering unfair competition. The
> university will punish cheaters with failure on an assignment,
> failure in a course, permanent transcript notation, suspension, and/or
> expulsion. Offenses may be reported to medical, law or other professional
> or graduate schools when a cheater applies.
> 
> Violations can include cheating on exams, plagiarism, reuse of assignments
> without permission, improper use of the Internet and electronic devices,
> unauthorized collaboration, alteration of graded assignments, forgery
> and falsification, lying, facilitating academic dishonesty, and unfair
> competition. Ignorance of these rules is not an excuse.
> 
> Academic honesty is required in all work you submit to be graded. Except
> where the instructor specifies group work, you must solve all homework and
> programming assignments without the help of others. For example, you must
> not look at anyone else’s solutions (including program code) to your
> homework problems. However, you may discuss assignment specifications
> (not solutions) with others to be sure you understand what is required
> by the assignment.
> 
> If your instructor permits using fragments of source code from outside
> sources, such as your textbook or on-line resources, you must properly
> cite the source. Not citing it constitutes plagiarism. Similarly, your
> group projects must list everyone who participated.
> 
> Falsifying program output or results is prohibited.
> 
> Your instructor is free to override parts of this policy for particular
> assignments. To protect yourself: (1) Ask the instructor if you are not
> sure what is permissible. (2) Seek help from the instructor, TA or CAs,
> as you are always encouraged to do, rather than from other students. (3)
> Cite any questionable sources of help you may have received.
> 
> On every exam, you will sign the following pledge: "I agree to complete
> this exam without unauthorized assistance from any person, materials or
> device. [Signed and dated]". Your course instructors will let you know
> where to find copies of old exams, if they are available.

Please note that submitting code, writing, or other products generated by
AI (including but not limited to ChatGPT and Github Copilot) is considered
to be a violation of academic ethics.

### Mental Health Statement

JHU has several resources to support students. Many students struggle
with stress at times with stress, anxiety, and depression. The Counseling
Center has many resources available to students:

[Johns Hopkins University Student Well-Being](https://wellbeing.jhu.edu/)

![JHU well-being website QR code](img/wellbeing_qrcode.png)

In addition, The Johns Hopkins University Behavioral Health Crisis
Support Team (BHCST) pairs experienced, compassionate crisis clinicians
with specially trained public safety officers on every shift on and
around the Homewood campus, seven days a week. The BHCST will provide
immediate assistance to those who need it and, just as importantly,
link individuals in crisis to ongoing support services in the days
and weeks that follow. Call Public Safety, 410-516-5600, and ask for a
BHCST clinician.

If you have concerns about a specific student, please contact: 

* For [emergencies](https://security.jhu.edu/index.html) (threat to self or others): 410-516-4600 or 911
* For on-scene mental health support: BHCST at 410-516-4600

### Academic Integrity

The strength of the university depends on academic and personal
integrity. In this course, you must be honest and truthful. Ethical
violations include cheating on exams, plagiarism, reuse of assignments,
improper use of the internet and electronic devices, unauthorized
collaboration, alteration of graded assignments, forgery and
falsification, lying, facilitating academic dishonesty, and unfair
competition.

Report any violations you witness to the instructor. You can also contact:   

* For undergraduates: the associate dean of student conduct (or designee)
  by calling the Office of the Dean of Student Life at 410-516-8208 or
  via email at <mailto:studentconduct@jhu.edu>
* For KSAS Graduate Students: <mailto:rseitz5@jh.edu>

For graduate students the policy can be found
on the Homewood Graduate and Postdoc Affairs
[website](https://homewoodgrad.jhu.edu/academics/policies/).

### Inclusivity

Johns Hopkins University is committed to creating a classroom
environment that values the diversity of experiences and perspectives
that all students bring.  Everyone here has the right to be treated
with dignity and respect.  Fostering an inclusive climate is important
because research and experience show that students who interact with
peers who are different from themselves learn new things and experience
tangible educational outcomes.  Please join us in creating a welcoming
and vibrant classroom climate.  Note that you should expect to be
challenged intellectually by the instructor, the TAs, and your peers,
and at times this may feel uncomfortable.  Indeed, it can be helpful to
be pushed sometimes in order to learn and grow.  But at no time in this
learning process should someone be singled out or treated unequally on
the basis of any seen or unseen part of their identity.

If you ever have concerns in this course about harassment, discrimination,
or any unequal treatment, or if you seek accommodations or resources,
please reach out to your instructor or the TAs who will take your
communication seriously and will seek mutually acceptable resolutions
and accommodations.  Reporting will never impact your course grade.
You may also share concerns with the department chair, the Director of
Undergraduate Studies (WSE Department Heads and DUSes), the WSE Assistant
Dean for Diversity and Inclusion (Darlene Saporu, <mailto:dsaporu@jhu.edu>),
the KSAS Assistant Dean for Diversity and Inclusion (Araceli Frias,
<mailto:afrias3@jhu.edu>) or the Office of Institutional Equity (<mailto:oie@jhu.edu>).
In handling reports, people will protect your privacy as much as possible,
but faculty and staff are required to officially report information for
some cases (e.g., sexual harassment).
