# Assignments

This page lists assignments.

*Individual* assignments must be completed individually.

For *Group* assignments, you may work in a team with up to
3 members, or do the assignment individually.

Please consult the [Setup Instructions](assign/setup.html) for information
about getting started working on the assignments, including cloning
the starter code and getting access to the required software.

The assignment descriptions linked below describe the tasks and
deliverables for each assignment. Further information can
be found in the [JHU Pintos manual](assign/pintos/pintos.html), and the
assignment descriptions will link to this document as
appropriate.

*Acknowledgment*: The assignments were developed by
[Prof. Ryan Huang](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~ryanph/),
based on work by the [Pintos](https://pintos-os.org/)
team, especially [Ben Pfaff](https://benpfaff.org/).
