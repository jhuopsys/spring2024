# Assignments

This page lists assignments and their due dates.

**Individual** assignments must be completed individually.

For **Group** assignments, you may work in a team with up to
3 members, or do the assignment individually.
If you work in a team with multiple members, it is expected
that each member will contribute substantially. We reserve
the right not to award credit for an assignment to a student who
has not made a substantial contribution.

Please consult the [Setup Instructions](assign/setup.html) for information
about getting started working on the assignments, including cloning
the starter code and getting access to the required software.
You will need to do this before you can make progress on any of
the assignments.
