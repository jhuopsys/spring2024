# Project 1: Threads

**Due:** Friday, Feb 23rd by 11 pm

In this assignment, we give you a minimally functional thread system.
Your job is to extend the functionality of this system to gain a better
understanding of synchronization problems.

You will be working primarily in the "`threads`" directory for this
assignment, with some work in the "`devices`" directory on the side.
Compilation should be done in the "`threads`" directory.

Before you read the description of this project, you should read all of
the following sections: [1. Introduction](pintos/pintos_1.html#SEC1), [C.
Coding Standards](pintos/pintos_9.html#SEC149), [Testing and
Debugging](pintos/debugtest.html). You should at least skim the material from
[A.1 Loading](pintos/pintos_7.html#SEC102) through [A.5 Memory
Allocation](pintos/pintos_7.html#SEC122), especially [A.3
Synchronization](pintos/pintos_7.html#SEC111). To complete this project you
will also need to read [B. 4.4BSD Scheduler](pintos/pintos_8.html#SEC142).

## Background

### Understanding Threads

The first step is to read and understand the code for the initial thread
system. Pintos already implements thread creation and thread completion,
a simple scheduler to switch between threads, and synchronization
primitives (semaphores, locks, condition variables, and optimization
barriers).

Some of this code might seem slightly mysterious. If you haven\'t
already compiled and run the base system, as described in the
introduction (see section [1. Introduction](pintos/pintos_1.html#SEC1)), you
should do so now. You can read through parts of the source code to see
what\'s going on. If you like, you can add calls to `printf()` almost
anywhere, then recompile and run to see what happens and in what order.
You can also run the kernel in a debugger and set breakpoints at
interesting spots, single-step through code and examine data, and so on.

When a thread is created, you are creating a new context to be
scheduled. You provide a function to be run in this context as an
argument to `thread_create()`. The first time the thread is scheduled
and runs, it starts from the beginning of that function and executes in
that context. When the function returns, the thread terminates. Each
thread, therefore, acts like a mini-program running inside Pintos, with
the function passed to `thread_create()` acting like `main()`.

At any given time, exactly one thread runs and the rest, if any, become
inactive. The scheduler decides which thread to run next. (If no thread
is ready to run at any given time, then the special \"idle\" thread,
implemented in `idle()`, runs.) Synchronization primitives can force
context switches when one thread needs to wait for another thread to do
something.

The mechanics of a context switch are in "`threads/switch.S`", which is
80`x`86 assembly code. (You don\'t have to understand it.) It
saves the state of the currently running thread and restores the state
of the thread we\'re switching to.

Using the GDB debugger, slowly trace through a context switch to see
what happens (see section [E.5 GDB](pintos/pintos_11.html#SEC162)). You can set
a breakpoint on `schedule()` to start out, and then single-step from
there.[(1)](pintos/pintos_fot.html#FOOT1) Be sure to keep track of each
thread\'s address and state, and what procedures are on the call stack
for each thread. You will notice that when one thread calls
`switch_threads()`, another thread starts running, and the first thing
the new thread does is to return from `switch_threads()`. You will
understand the thread system once you understand why and how the
`switch_threads()` that gets called is different from the
`switch_threads()` that returns. See section [A.2.3 Thread
Switching](pintos/pintos_7.html#SEC110), for more information.

<div class='admonition danger'>
  <div class='title'>Warning</div>
  <div class='content' markdown='1'>
In Pintos, each thread is assigned a small, fixed-size execution stack
just under 4 kB in size. The kernel tries to detect stack overflow, but
it cannot do so perfectly. You may cause bizarre problems, such as
mysterious kernel panics, if you declare large data structures as
non-static local variables, e.g. "`int buf[1000];`".
Alternatives to stack allocation include the page allocator and the
block allocator (see section [A.5 Memory
Allocation](pintos/pintos_7.html#SEC122)).
  </div>
</div>

### Source Files

[Listing 1](assign01/listing_1.html) provides a brief overview
of the files in the "`threads`" directory. You will not need to modify
most of this code, but the hope is that presenting this overview will
give you a start on what code to look at.

### Synchronization

Proper synchronization is an important part of the solutions to these
problems. Any synchronization problem can be easily solved by turning
interrupts off: while interrupts are off, there is no concurrency, so
there\'s no possibility for race conditions. Therefore, it\'s tempting
to solve all synchronization problems this way, but **don\'t**. Instead,
use semaphores, locks, and condition variables to solve the bulk of your
synchronization problems. Read the tour section on synchronization (see
section [A.3 Synchronization](pintos/pintos_7.html#SEC111)) or the comments in
"`threads/synch.c`" if you\'re unsure what synchronization primitives
may be used in what situations.

In the Pintos projects, the only class of problem best solved by
disabling interrupts is coordinating data shared between a kernel thread
and an interrupt handler. Because interrupt handlers can\'t sleep, they
can\'t acquire locks. This means that data shared between kernel threads
and an interrupt handler must be protected within a kernel thread by
turning off interrupts.

This project only requires accessing a little bit of thread state from
interrupt handlers. For the alarm clock, the timer interrupt needs to
wake up sleeping threads. In the advanced scheduler, the timer interrupt
needs to access a few global and per-thread variables. When you access
these variables from kernel threads, you will need to disable interrupts
to prevent the timer interrupt from interfering.

When you do turn off interrupts, take care to do so for the least amount
of code possible, or you can end up losing important things such as
timer ticks or input events. Turning off interrupts also increases the
interrupt handling latency, which can make a machine feel sluggish if
taken too far.

The synchronization primitives themselves in "`synch.c`" are implemented
by disabling interrupts. You may need to increase the amount of code
that runs with interrupts disabled here, but you should still try to
keep it to a minimum.

Disabling interrupts can be useful for debugging, if you want to make
sure that a section of code is not interrupted. You should remove
debugging code before turning in your project. (Don\'t just comment it
out, because that can make the code difficult to read.)

There should be no busy waiting in your submission. A tight loop that
calls `thread_yield()` is one form of busy waiting.

### Development Suggestions

In the past, many groups divided the assignment into pieces, then each
group member worked on his or her piece until just before the deadline,
at which time the group reconvened to combine their code and submit.
**This is a bad idea. We do not recommend this approach.** Groups that
do this often find that two changes conflict with each other, requiring
lots of last-minute debugging. Some groups who have done this have
turned in code that did not even compile or boot, much less pass any
tests.

Instead, we recommend integrating your team\'s changes early and often,
using a source code control system such as Git (see section [F.3
Git](pintos/pintos_12.html#SEC172)). This is less likely to produce surprises,
because everyone can see everyone else\'s code as it is written, instead
of just when it is finished. These systems also make it possible to
review changes and, when a change introduces a bug, drop back to working
versions of code.

You should expect to run into bugs that you simply don\'t understand
while working on this and subsequent projects. When you do, reread the
appendix on debugging tools, which is filled with useful debugging tips
that should help you to get back up to speed (see section [E. Debugging
Tools](pintos/pintos_11.html#SEC156)). Be sure to read the section on
backtraces (see section [E.4 Backtraces](pintos/pintos_11.html#SEC160)), which
will help you to get the most out of every kernel panic or assertion
failure.

<div class='admonition tip'>
  <div class='title'>Tip</div>
  <div class='content' markdown='1'>
We also suggest you to read the requirement description as well as the
[FAQs](#SEC39) carefullyâ€”perhaps multiple times. A lot of the
confusions come from not reading them carefully.

`make check` runs all tests. If you are debugging one test, you can run
just that test with `make tests/threads/<test_case>.result`. Read the
[Testing](pintos/debugtest.html) part for more details.
  </div>
</div>

## Suggested Order of Implementation

We suggest first implementing the following, which can happen in
parallel:

-   Optimized `timer_sleep()` in Exercise 1.1.
-   Basic support for priority scheduling in Exercise 2.1 when a new
    thread is created in `thread_create()`.
-   Implement fixed-point real arithmetic routines
    ([B.6 Fixed-Point Real Arithmetic](pintos/pintos_8.html#SEC148)) that are needed for MLFQS in
    exercise 3.1.

Then you can add full support for priority scheduling in Exercise 2.1 by
considering all other possible scenarios and the synchronization
primitives.

Then you can tackle either Exercise 3.1 first or Exercise 2.2 first.

## Project 1 Requirements

### 0. Design Document

Before you turn in your project, you must copy [the project 1 design
document template](threads.tmpl) into your source tree under the name
"`pintos/src/threads/DESIGNDOC`" and fill it in. We recommend that you
read the design document template before you start working on the
project. See section [D. Project Documentation](pintos/pintos_10.html#SEC153),
for a sample design document that goes along with a fictitious project.

### 1. Alarm Clock

<div class='admonition exercise'>
  <div class='title'>Exercise 1.1</div>
  <div class='content' markdown='1'>
Reimplement `timer_sleep()`, defined in "`devices/timer.c`". Although a
working implementation is provided, it \"busy waits,\" that is, it spins
in a loop checking the current time and calling `thread_yield()` until
enough time has gone by. Reimplement it to avoid busy waiting.
  </div>
</div>

<u>Function:</u> void **timer_sleep** (int64\_t `ticks`)

:   Suspends execution of the calling thread until time has advanced by
    at least given number of timer ticks. Unless the system is otherwise
    idle, the thread need not wake up after exactly the specified number of
    ticks. Just put it on the ready queue after they have waited for the
    right amount of time.

    `timer_sleep()` is useful for threads that operate in real-time,
    e.g. for blinking the cursor once per second.

    The argument to `timer_sleep()` is expressed in timer ticks, not in
    milliseconds or any another unit. There are `TIMER_FREQ` timer ticks
    per second, where `TIMER_FREQ` is a macro defined in
    `devices/timer.h`. The default value is 100. We don\'t recommend
    changing this value, because any change is likely to cause many of
    the tests to fail.

Separate functions `timer_msleep()`, `timer_usleep()`, and
`timer_nsleep()` do exist for sleeping a specific number of
milliseconds, microseconds, or nanoseconds, respectively, but these will
call `timer_sleep()` automatically when necessary. You do not need to
modify them.

If your delays seem too short or too long, reread the explanation of the
"`-r`" option to `pintos` (see section [1.1.4 Debugging versus
Testing](pintos/pintos_1.html#SEC6)).

<div class='admonition tip'>
  <div class='title'>Hint</div>
  <div class='content' markdown='1'>
You may find `struct list` and the provided functions to be useful for
this exercise. Read the comments in `lib/kernel/list.h` carefully, since
this list design/usage is different from the typical linked list you are
familiar with (actually, Linux kernel [uses a similar
design](https://0xax.gitbooks.io/linux-insides/content/DataStructures/linux-datastructures-1.html)).
Searching the Pintos codebase to see how `struct list` is used may also
give you some inspirations.
  </div>
</div>

<div class='admonition tip'>
  <div class='title'>Hint</div>
  <div class='content' markdown='1'>
Instead of directly manipulating a thread\'s status, you may want to
leverage some synchronization primitive that provides some sort of
thread *\"waiting\"* functionality, e.g., semaphore. These primitives
already take care of setting a thread\'s status and putting it into the
proper list. You do not have to wait for the Synchronization Lecture to
be able to use these primitives. Reading through section [A.3
Synchronization](pintos/pintos_7.html#SEC111) is sufficient.

In addition, when modifying some global variable, e.g., a global list,
you will need to use some synchronization primitive as well to ensure it
is not modified or read concurrently (e.g., a timer interrupt occurs
during the modification and we switch to run another thread).
  </div>
</div>

<div class='admonition tip'>
  <div class='title'>Tip</div>
  <div class='content' markdown='1'>
You need to decide where to check whether the elapsed time exceeded the
sleep time. The original `timer_sleep` implementation calls
`timer_ticks`, which returns the current `ticks`. Check where the static
`ticks` variable is *updated*. You can search with `grep` or use
`cscope` to help you find this out: type `make cscope`, then type
`cscope -d`, in the `Find this C symbol:` type `ticks`.
  </div>
</div>

The alarm clock implementation is *not* needed for later projects,
although it could be useful for project 4.

### 2. Priority Scheduling

<div class='admonition exercise'>
  <div class='title'>Exercise 2.1</div>
  <div class='content' markdown='1'>
Implement priority scheduling in Pintos. When a thread is added to the
ready list that has a higher priority than the currently running thread,
the current thread should immediately yield the processor to the new
thread. Similarly, when threads are waiting for a lock, semaphore, or
condition variable, the highest priority waiting thread should be
awakened first. A thread may raise or lower its own priority at any
time, but lowering its priority such that it no longer has the highest
priority must cause it to immediately yield the CPU.
  </div>
</div>

Thread priorities range from `PRI_MIN` (0) to `PRI_MAX` (63). Lower
numbers correspond to lower priorities, so that priority 0 is the lowest
priority and priority 63 is the highest. The initial thread priority is
passed as an argument to `thread_create()`. If there\'s no reason to
choose another priority, use `PRI_DEFAULT` (31). The `PRI_` macros are
defined in "`threads/thread.h`", and you should not change their values.

<div class='admonition tip'>
  <div class='title'>Hint</div>
  <div class='content' markdown='1'>
For this exercise, you need to consider all the scenarios where the
priority must be enforced. For example, when an alarm clock for a thread
fires off, that thread should be made ready again, which entails a
priority check. You can find some of these scenarios by looking for
places that modify `ready_list` (directly and indirectly, `cscope` can
be helpful).
  </div>
</div>

<div class='admonition tip'>
  <div class='title'>Hint</div>
  <div class='content' markdown='1'>
To yield the CPU, you can check the thread APIs in `threads/thread.h`.
Read the comment and implementation of the corresponding thread function
in `threads/thread.c`. That function may not be used in interrupt
context (i.e., should not call it inside an interrupt handler). To yield
the CPU in the interrupt context, you can take a look at functions in
`threads/interrupt.c`. Again, if you want to use an existing function,
you can use `cscope` to find the references to get a sense of how that
function is used.
  </div>
</div>

One issue with priority scheduling is \"priority inversion\". Consider
high, medium, and low priority threads `H`, `M`,
and `L`, respectively. If `H` needs to wait for
`L` (for instance, for a lock held by `L`), and
`M` is on the ready list, then `H` will never get
the CPU because the low priority thread will not get any CPU time. A
partial fix for this problem is for `H` to \"donate\" its
priority to `L` while `L` is holding the lock,
then recall the donation once `L` releases (and thus
`H` acquires) the lock.

<div class='admonition exercise'>
  <div class='title'>Exercise 2.2</div>
  <div class='content' markdown='1'>
Implement priority donation. You will need to account for all different
situations in which priority donation is required. You must implement
priority donation for locks. You need not implement priority donation
for the other Pintos synchronization constructs. You do need to
implement priority scheduling in all cases. Be sure to handle multiple
donations, in which multiple priorities are donated to a single thread.
  </div>
</div>

<div class='admonition danger'>
  <div class='title'>Challenge (extra credit)</div>
  <div class='content' markdown='1'>
Support nested priority donation: if `H` is waiting on a lock
that `M` holds and `M` is waiting on a lock that
`L` holds, then both `M` and `L` should
be boosted to `H`\'s priority. If necessary, you may impose a
reasonable limit on depth of nested priority donation, such as 8 levels.
  </div>
</div>

Note: if you decide not to work on this extra credit exercise, you do
not need to pass the `priority-donate-nest` and `priority-donate-chain`
tests.

<div class='admonition exercise'>
  <div class='title'>Exercise 2.3</div>
  <div class='content' markdown='1'>
Implement the following functions that allow a thread to examine and
modify its own priority. Skeletons for these functions are provided in
"`threads/thread.c`".
  </div>
</div>

<u>Function:</u> void **thread_set_priority** (int `new_priority`)
:   Sets the current thread\'s priority to `new_priority`. If
    the current thread no longer has the highest priority, yields.

<u>Function:</u> int **thread_get_priority** (void)
:   Returns the current thread\'s priority. In the presence of priority
    donation, returns the higher (donated) priority.

You need not provide any interface to allow a thread to directly modify
other threads\' priorities.

The priority scheduler is not used in any later project.

### 3. Advanced Scheduler

<div class='admonition exercise'>
  <div class='title'>Exercise 3.1</div>
  <div class='content' markdown='1'>
Implement a multilevel feedback queue scheduler similar to the 4.4BSD
scheduler to reduce the average response time for running jobs on your
system. See section [B. 4.4BSD Scheduler](pintos/pintos_8.html#SEC142), for
detailed requirements.
  </div>
</div>

Like the priority scheduler, the advanced scheduler chooses the thread
to run based on priorities. However, the advanced scheduler does not do
priority donation. Thus, we recommend that you have the priority
scheduler working, except possibly for priority donation, before you
start work on the advanced scheduler.

You must write your code to allow us to choose a scheduling algorithm
policy at Pintos startup time. By default, the priority scheduler must
be active, but we must be able to choose the 4.4BSD scheduler with the
"`-mlfqs`" kernel option. Passing this option sets
`thread_mlfqs`, declared in "`threads/thread.h`", to true when the
options are parsed by `parse_options()`, which happens early in
`main()`.

When the 4.4BSD scheduler is enabled, threads no longer directly control
their own priorities. The `priority` argument to
`thread_create()` should be ignored, as well as any calls to
`thread_set_priority()`, and `thread_get_priority()` should return the
thread\'s current priority as set by the scheduler.

<div class='admonition tip'>
  <div class='title'>Hint</div>
  <div class='content' markdown='1'>
Double check the implementations of your fixed-point arithmetic routines
(and ideally have some unit test for them). Some simple mistake in these
routines could result in mysterious issue in your scheduler.
  </div>
</div>

<div class='admonition tip'>
  <div class='title'>Hint</div>
  <div class='content' markdown='1'>
Efficiency matters a lot for the MLFQS exercise. An inefficient
implementation can distort the system. Read the comment in test case
`mlfqs-load-avg.c`. In fact, the inefficiency in your alarm clock
implementation can also influence your MLFQS behavior. So double check
if your implementation there can be optimized.
  </div>
</div>

The advanced scheduler is not used in any later project.

## Submission Instructions

Please follow the following instructions *carefully* to submit your work.

Start by committing and pushing your work to your team's Github repository.
When you run the command

<div class='highlighter-rouge shell'><pre>
git status -s
</pre></div>

you should see **no** output.

Go to the webpage for your team's Github repository. Click on the link
that reads "<i>N</i> commits":

<div class="content-image" markdown="1">

</div>

Locate the earliest commit that was part of your work on Assignment 1.
Copy its commit hash (which will be a string of hexadecimal digits.)
In my repository, the hash of the first Assignment 1 commit was `9c91bba`.
This is your "base commit".

Next, change directory to the root directory of your repository.
This directory should contain a file `README.md` and a directory
called `src`.

From the root directory of your repository, run the following commands:

## A. FAQ

### How much code will I need to write?

Here\'s a summary of our reference solution, produced by the
`diffstat` program. The final row gives total lines inserted and
deleted; a changed line counts as both an insertion and a deletion.

The reference solution represents just one possible solution. Many
other solutions are also possible and many of those differ greatly
from the reference solution. Some excellent solutions may not modify
all the files modified by the reference solution, and some may
modify files not modified by the reference solution.

```
devices/timer.c       |   42 +++++-
threads/fixed-point.h |  120 ++++++++++++++++++
threads/synch.c       |   88 ++++++++++++-
threads/thread.c      |  196 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++----
threads/thread.h      |   23 +++
5 files changed, 440 insertions(+), 29 deletions(-)
```

"`fixed-point.h`" is a new file added by the reference solution.

### How do I update the "`Makefile`"s when I add a new source file?

To add a "`.c`" file, edit the top-level
"`Makefile.build`". Add the new file to variable
"`dir``_SRC`", where `dir` is the
directory where you added the file. For this project, that means you
should add it to `threads_SRC` or `devices_SRC`. Then run `make`. If
your new file doesn\'t get compiled, run `make clean` and then try
again.

When you modify the top-level "`Makefile.build`" and re-run `make`,
the modified version should be automatically copied to
"`threads/build/Makefile`". The converse is not true, so any changes
will be lost the next time you run `make clean` from the "`threads`"
directory. Unless your changes are truly temporary, you should
prefer to edit "`Makefile.build`".

A new "`.h`" file does not require editing the "`Makefile`"s.

### What does "warning: no previous prototype for `func`" mean?

It means that you defined a non-`static` function without preceding
it by a prototype. Because non-`static` functions are intended for
use by other "`.c`" files, for safety they should be prototyped in a
header file included before their definition. To fix the problem,
add a prototype in a header file that you include, or, if the
function isn\'t actually used by other "`.c`" files, make it
`static`.

### What is the interval between timer interrupts?

Timer interrupts occur `TIMER_FREQ` times per second. You can adjust
this value by editing "`devices/timer.h`". The default is 100 Hz.

We don\'t recommend changing this value, because any changes are
likely to cause many of the tests to fail.

### How long is a time slice?

There are `TIME_SLICE` ticks per time slice. This macro is declared
in "`threads/thread.c`". The default is 4 ticks.

We don\'t recommend changing this value, because any changes are
likely to cause many of the tests to fail.

### How do I run the tests?

See section [Testing](pintos/debugtest.html).

### Why do I get a test failure in `pass()`?

You are probably looking at a backtrace
that looks something like this:

```
0xc0108810: debug_panic (lib/kernel/debug.c:32)
0xc010a99f: pass (tests/threads/tests.c:93)
0xc010bdd3: test_mlfqs_load_1 (...threads/mlfqs-load-1.c:33)
0xc010a8cf: run_test (tests/threads/tests.c:51)
0xc0100452: run_task (threads/init.c:283)
0xc0100536: run_actions (threads/init.c:333)
0xc01000bb: main (threads/init.c:137)
```

This is just confusing output from the `backtrace` program. It does
not actually mean that `pass()` called `debug_panic()`. In fact,
`fail()` called `debug_panic()` (via the `PANIC()` macro). GCC knows
that `debug_panic()` does not return, because it is declared
`NO_RETURN` (see section [E.3 Function and Parameter
Attributes](pintos/pintos_11.html#SEC159)), so it doesn\'t include any code
in `fail()` to take control when `debug_panic()` returns. This means
that the return address on the stack looks like it is at the
beginning of the function that happens to follow `fail()` in memory,
which in this case happens to be `pass()`.

See section [E.4 Backtraces](pintos/pintos_11.html#SEC160), for more
information.

**How do interrupts get re-enabled in the new thread following `schedule()`?**

Every path into `schedule()` disables interrupts. They eventually
get re-enabled by the next thread to be scheduled. Consider the
possibilities: the new thread is running in `switch_thread()` (but
see below), which is called by `schedule()`, which is called by one
of a few possible functions:

-   `thread_exit()`, but we\'ll never switch back into such a
    thread, so it\'s uninteresting.
-   `thread_yield()`, which immediately restores the interrupt level
    upon return from `schedule()`.
-   `thread_block()`, which is called from multiple places:
    -   `sema_down()`, which restores the interrupt level before
        returning.
    -   `idle()`, which enables interrupts with an explicit assembly
        STI instruction.
    -   `wait()` in "`devices/intq.c`", whose callers are
        responsible for re-enabling interrupts.

There is a special case when a newly created thread runs for the
first time. Such a thread calls `intr_enable()` as the first action
in `kernel_thread()`, which is at the bottom of the call stack for
every kernel thread but the first.

### A.1 Alarm Clock FAQ

**Do I need to account for timer values overflowing?**

Don\'t worry about the possibility of timer values overflowing.
Timer values are expressed as signed 64-bit numbers, which at 100
ticks per second should be good for almost 2,924,712,087 years. By
then, we expect Pintos to have been phased out of the Computer
Science curriculum.

### A.2 Priority Scheduling FAQ

**Doesn\'t priority scheduling lead to starvation?**

Yes, strict priority scheduling can lead to starvation because a
thread will not run if any higher-priority thread is runnable. The
advanced scheduler introduces a mechanism for dynamically changing
thread priorities.

Strict priority scheduling is valuable in real-time systems because
it offers the programmer more control over which jobs get processing
time. High priorities are generally reserved for time-critical
tasks. It\'s not \"fair,\" but it addresses other concerns not
applicable to a general-purpose operating system.

**What thread should run after a lock has been released?**

When a lock is released, the highest priority thread waiting for
that lock should be unblocked and put on the list of ready threads.
The scheduler should then run the highest priority thread on the
ready list.

**If the highest-priority thread yields, does it continue running?**

Yes. If there is a single highest-priority thread, it continues
running until it blocks or finishes, even if it calls
`thread_yield()`. If multiple threads have the same highest
priority, `thread_yield()` should switch among them in \"round
robin\" order.

**What happens to the priority of a donating thread?**

Priority donation only changes the priority of the donee thread. The
donor thread\'s priority is unchanged. Priority donation is not
additive: if thread `A` (with priority 5) donates to
thread `B` (with priority 3), then `B`\'s new
priority is 5, not 8.

**Can a thread\'s priority change while it is on the ready queue?**

Yes. Consider a ready, low-priority thread `L` that holds
a lock. High-priority thread `H` attempts to acquire the
lock and blocks, thereby donating its priority to ready thread
`L`.

**Can a thread\'s priority change while it is blocked?**

Yes. While a thread that has acquired lock `L` is blocked
for any reason, its priority can increase by priority donation if a
higher-priority thread attempts to acquire `L`. This case
is checked by the `priority-donate-sema` test.

**Can a thread added to the ready list preempt the processor?**

Yes. If a thread added to the ready list has higher priority than
the running thread, the correct behavior is to immediately yield the
processor. It is not acceptable to wait for the next timer
interrupt. The highest priority thread should run as soon as it is
runnable, preempting whatever thread is currently running.

**How does `thread_set_priority()` affect a thread receiving donations?**

It sets the thread\'s base priority. The thread\'s effective
priority becomes the higher of the newly set priority or the highest
donated priority. When the donations are released, the thread\'s
priority becomes the one set through the function call. This
behavior is checked by the `priority-donate-lower` test.

**Doubled test names in output make them fail.**

Suppose you are seeing output in which some test names are doubled,
like this:

```
(alarm-priority) begin
(alarm-priority) (alarm-priority) Thread priority 30 woke up.
Thread priority 29 woke up.
(alarm-priority) Thread priority 28 woke up.
```

What is happening is that output from two threads is being
interleaved. That is, one thread is printing
`"(alarm-priority) Thread priority 29 woke up.\n"` and another
thread is printing
`"(alarm-priority) Thread priority 30 woke up.\n"`, but the first
thread is being preempted by the second in the middle of its output.

This problem indicates a bug in your priority scheduler. After all,
a thread with priority 29 should not be able to run while a thread
with priority 30 has work to do.

Normally, the implementation of the `printf()` function in the
Pintos kernel attempts to prevent such interleaved output by
acquiring a console lock during the duration of the `printf` call
and releasing it afterwards. However, the output of the test name,
e.g., `(alarm-priority)`, and the message following it is output
using two calls to `printf`, resulting in the console lock being
acquired and released twice.

### A.3 Advanced Scheduler FAQ

**How does priority donation interact with the advanced scheduler?**

It doesn\'t have to. We won\'t test priority donation and the
advanced scheduler at the same time.

**Can I use one queue instead of 64 queues?**

Yes. In general, your implementation may differ from the
description, as long as its behavior is the same.

**Some scheduler tests fail and I don\'t understand why. Help!**

If your implementation mysteriously fails some of the advanced
scheduler tests, try the following:

-   Read the source files for the tests that you\'re failing, to
    make sure that you understand what\'s going on. Each one has a
    comment at the top that explains its purpose and expected
    results.
-   Double-check your fixed-point arithmetic routines and your use
    of them in the scheduler routines.
-   Consider how much work your implementation does in the timer
    interrupt. If the timer interrupt handler takes too long, then
    it will take away most of a timer tick from the thread that the
    timer interrupt preempted. When it returns control to that
    thread, it therefore won\'t get to do much work before the next
    timer interrupt arrives. That thread will therefore get blamed
    for a lot more CPU time than it actually got a chance to use.
    This raises the interrupted thread\'s recent CPU count, thereby
    lowering its priority. It can cause scheduling decisions to
    change. It also raises the load average.
