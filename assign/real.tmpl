			     Booting Pintos
			     ==============

---- QUESTIONS ---- 
>> Put the screenshots of Pintos running in src/p0.
>> A1: Is there any particular issue that you would like us to know?

			     Debugging
			     =========

---- QUESTIONS: BIOS ---- 
>> B1: What is the first instruction that gets executed?

>> B2: At which physical address is this instruction located?

>> B3: Can you guess why the first instruction is like this?

>> B4: What are the next three instructions?

---- QUESTIONS: BOOTLOADER ---- 
>> B5: How does the bootloader read disk sectors? In particular, what BIOS interrupt
is used?

>> B6: How does the bootloader decides whether it successfully finds the Pintos kernel?

>> B7: What happens when the bootloader could not find the Pintos kernel?

>> B8: At what point and how exactly does the bootloader transfer control to the Pintos kernel?

---- QUESTIONS: KERNEL ---- 
>> B9: At the entry of pintos_init(), what is the value of expression 
init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))] in hexadecimal format?

>> B10: When palloc_get_page() is called for the first time,

>> B10.1 what does the call stack look like?

>> B10.2 what is the return value in hexadecimal format?

>> B10.3 what is the value of expression init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))] in hexadecimal format?

>> B11: When palloc_get_page() is called for the third time,

>> B11.1 what does the call stack look like?

>> B11.2 what is the return value in hexadecimal format?

>> B11.3 what is the value of expression init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))] in hexadecimal format?

			     Kernel Monitor
			     ==============

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

---- ALGORITHMS ----
>> C2: Explain how you read and write to the console for the kernel monitor.

>> C3: Any additional enhancement you implement?
